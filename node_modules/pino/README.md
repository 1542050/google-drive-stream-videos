## Install

```
npm install pino --save
```

If you need support for Node.js v0.12 or v0.10, please install the latest 2.x release using the `legacy` tag:

```
npm install pino@legacy --save
```

Documentation for the legacy version 2.x is available on the [`v2.x.x` branch](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/tree/v2.x.x).

## Usage

```js
'use strict'

var pino = require('pino')()

pino.info('hello world')
pino.error('this is at error level')
pino.info('the answer is %d', 42)
pino.info({ obj: 42 }, 'hello world')
pino.info({ obj: 42, b: 2 }, 'hello world')
pino.info({ obj: { aa: 'bbb' } }, 'another')
setImmediate(function () {
  pino.info('after setImmediate')
})
pino.error(new Error('an error'))

var child = pino.child({ a: 'property' })
child.info('hello child!')

var childsChild = child.child({ another: 'property' })
childsChild.info('hello baby..')

```

This produces:

```

## Benchmarks
As far as we know, it is one of the fastest loggers in town:

`pino.info('hello %s %j %d', 'world', {obj: true}, 4, {another: 'obj'})`:

```
benchDebugInterpolateExtra*10000: 640.001ms
benchBunyanInterpolateExtra*10000: 2888.825ms

benchPinoExtremeInterpolateExtra*10000: 314.635ms
benchPinoUnsafeExtremeInterpolateExtra*10000: 294.915ms
```

In many cases, pino is over 6x faster than alternatives.

For a fair comparison, [LogLevel](http://npm.im/loglevel) was extended
to include a timestamp and [bole](http://npm.im/bole) had
`fastTime` mode switched on.

<a name="browser"></a>
## Pino in the browser

Pino is compatible with [`browserify`](http://npm.im) for browser side usage:

This can be useful with isomorphic/universal JavaScript code.

In the browser, `pino` uses corresponding [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) `console` methods (`console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.info`, `console.debug`, `console.trace`) and uses `console.error` for any `fatal` level logs.

<a name="caveats"></a>
## Caveats

There's some fine points to be aware of, which are a result of worthwhile trade-offs:

### 11 Arguments

The logger functions (e.g. `pino.info`) can take a maximum of 11 arguments.

If you need more than that to write a log entry, you're probably doing it wrong.

### Duplicate Keys

It's possible for naming conflicts to arise between child loggers and
children of child loggers.

This isn't as bad as it sounds, even if you do use the same keys between
parent and child loggers Pino resolves the conflict in the sanest way.

For example, consider the following:

```js
var pino = require('pino')
var fs = require('fs')
pino(fs.createWriteStream('./my-log'))
  .child({a: 'property'})
  .child({a: 'prop'})
  .info('howdy')
```

```sh
$ cat my-log
{"pid":95469,"hostname":"MacBook-Pro-3.home","level":30,"msg":"howdy","time":1459534114473,"a":"property","a":"prop","v":1}
```

Notice how there's two key's named `a` in the JSON output. The sub-childs properties
appear after the parent child properties. This means if we run our logs through `pino -t` (or convert them to objects in any other way) we'll end up with one `a` property whose value corresponds to the lowest child in the hierarchy:

```sh
$ cat my-log | pino -t
{"pid":95469,"hostname":"MacBook-Pro-3.home","level":30,"msg":"howdy","time":"2016-04-01T18:08:34.473Z","a":"prop","v":1}
```

This equates to the same log output that Bunyan supplies.

One of Pino's performance tricks is to avoid building objects and stringifying
them, so we're building strings instead. This is why duplicate keys between
parents and children will end up in log output.
